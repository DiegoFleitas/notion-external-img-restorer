Quick &amp; dirty notion integration to fix broken external images

https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion

Notion integrations do not have access to all pages by default. You need to share them with the integration manually

ex: Share Access on Individual Pages

If you want to grant access only to specific pages, follow these steps:

    Open a page in Notion.
    Click "..." (top right).
    Under "Connection", search for your integration.
    Add to page
